## Technical Architecture

![image_alt]()


## Project Overview

The "Automated Secure Backup & Recovery Vault" provides a strong disaster recovery solution using AWS to automatically safeguard EC2 instances by backing them up and restoring them when they encounter failures. The project uses Terraform for infrastructure as code to enable straightforward and consistent deployment processes.

## Project Objective

To build an automated, secure, and cost-efficient EC2 backup and recovery system that:

1.Takes periodic snapshots of EC2 instances.

2.Stores backups securely in Amazon S3 Glacier.

3.Detects EC2 failures and launches a new instance.

4.Restores the latest snapshot to the new instance.

5.Notifies administrators via Amazon SNS alerts.


##  Features

1.Automated EC2 Snapshot Management – Regular snapshots of EBS volumes ensure data protection.

2.Disaster Recovery – Auto-launches a new EC2 instance and restores the latest snapshot upon failure.

3.Cost Optimization – Stores backups in Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term retention at a lower cost.

4.Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) – Deploy AWS resources consistently and efficiently.

5.Event-Driven Architecture – Uses AWS Lambda & EventBridge to trigger backup and recovery.

6.Real-time Notifications – Sends SNS alerts for backup completion, failures, and recovery actions.

## Technology Used

1.AWS Lambda – Automates backup and recovery processes.

2.Amazon S3 Glacier – Cost-efficient storage for long-term backups.

3.Amazon SNS – Notifies administrators of backup and recovery events.

4.Amazon EventBridge – Triggers automated backups and recovery workflows.

5.AWS IAM – Secures access through fine-grained permissions.

6.Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage all AWS resources.

## Use Case

This project serves as a valuable resource for organizations and their cloud engineers and DevOps teams who need to establish dependable disaster recovery procedures on AWS. The project provides automatic recovery which prevents data loss and downtime while maintaining business continuity.

## Prerequisites

1.AWS Account with necessary permissions.

2.Terraform Installed on your local machine.

3.AWS CLI Configured with required IAM roles.
